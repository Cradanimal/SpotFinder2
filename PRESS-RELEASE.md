SpotFinderSkate
A app were skaters can post, find, and discuss local spots.

This app helps skateboards find new places to skateboard in their neighborhood, skaters can post new spots dicuss and leave comments on existing locations and check in to make meeting up easier. Skateboard has always been a self sustaining community, and this app builds on that by providing a basic templete and allowing the skaters to decide what information to include when adding a new spot. 

When you arrive in a new area it can be challenging to find places to skate, most parks aren't listed online and if they are they will be scattered across multiple pages and can contain outdated information. This app provides a space were the community can compile all the information and update it and ask questions as needed.
